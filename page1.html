        <p>Welcome to the world of Dying Light. You are a survivor in a zombie apocalypse.
            After the origins of the zombie outbreak in the city of Harran, most of humanity has fallen to
            the infected. You are completely alone. With the streets densely populated with the undead,
            you have adapted your body to be at its peak so that you can effectively parkour across the
            rooftops of the suburbs. It has been days since you have eaten a good meal to keep you going.
            One of the apartments near you has a good chance of having food. So you go and enter and search
            one. </p>
